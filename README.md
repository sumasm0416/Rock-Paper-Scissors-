# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This repository contains a simple implementation of the popular game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Python.

## Description

The "Rock Paper Scissors" game is a hand game played between two participants. Each participant simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (closed fist), paper (open hand), or scissors (index and middle fingers extended). The outcome of the game is determined by the rules:

- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.

This program allows users to play against the computer in multiple rounds of the game. The computer's choice is determined randomly. At the end of each round, the program displays the outcome and keeps track of the score. The game continues until the user decides to quit.

## Requirements

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer.
